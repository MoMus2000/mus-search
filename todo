Instead of using whole books.
Break the text down into smaller parts so that you can create the tf for that instead.
That way you will be able to return the matching value

Split page by page for the pdfs since they're already conveniently set up.

You can use google docs viewer to view your ppt and docx files, but they need to be on something like google drive
to be accessed

Or use pandoc to convert either the ppt or docx to html before serving.

pandoc demo.docx -o demo.html

UPDATE ppt wont work with pandoc

To make things easy recursively run pandoc on the data folder to preconvert it to text or pdf etc
